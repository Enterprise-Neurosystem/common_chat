Salient Discussion Points in the call today: 
On the approaches to describe various formats to exchange on channel:
MIME sepcfiications was discussed, but also points raised about it being inefficient and designed towards email. Sanjay will send linkes with AMQP experience -- are included in the notes below. 

Discussion was held on whether the protocol should focus on point-to-point (client-server) exchanges, or on multi-party exchanges. Elisa pointed out that modern protocols use third-party authentication tools, such as Google Authentication. Jinjun pointed out that in customer support it is common to bring another agent to help out. 

Consensus Decision: While the focus initially will be on point-to-point, we will make sure not to box out mechanisms that enable multi-party communications. 

Discussion on which use-cases should be used as an initial implementation to help in the protocol specification development. The following were proposed: 

1. Customer Support (in various cases) 
2. Expert Consultation [Medical ] 
3. Get Recommendations from one model and validate from another or an ensemble of models. Use the LLM as a judge for another LLM. 

As work evolves, we will pick a use-case (there was a lot of interest in 3 above which is easier to implement) 

There was a discussion on the need to have provenance of answers generated by the server. 
The consensus resulting from that we should divide the control channel and data channel into subchannels. A subchannel can include provenance information. At the same time, provenance is a tricky problem to solve in general. Subchannels would provide extensibility for capabilties that would be needed in the future.
