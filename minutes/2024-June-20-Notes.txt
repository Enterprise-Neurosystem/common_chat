Salient Discussion Points in the call today: 
On the approaches to describe various formats to exchange on channel:
MIME sepcfiications was discussed, but also points raised about it being inefficient and designed towards email. Sanjay will send linkes with AMQP experience -- are included in the notes below. 

Discussion was held on whether the protocol should focus on point-to-point (client-server) exchanges, or on multi-party exchanges. Elisa pointed out that modern protocols use third-party authentication tools, such as Google Authentication. Jinjun pointed out that in customer support it is common to bring another agent to help out. 

Consensus Decision: While the focus initially will be on point-to-point, we will make sure not to box out mechanisms that enable multi-party communications. 

Discussion on which use-cases should be used as an initial implementation to help in the protocol specification development. The following were proposed: 

1. Customer Support (in various cases) 
2. Expert Consultation [Medical ] 
3. Get Recommendations from one model and validate from another or an ensemble of models. Use the LLM as a judge for another LLM. 

As work evolves, we will pick a use-case (there was a lot of interest in 3 above which is easier to implement) 

There was a discussion on the need to have provenance of answers generated by the server. 
The consensus resulting from that we should divide the control channel and data channel into subchannels. A subchannel can include provenance information. At the same time, provenance is a tricky problem to solve in general. Subchannels would provide extensibility for capabilties that would be needed in the future.

Links sent out by Sanjay:
Hi everyone,

On today's call Dinesh had wanted me to share some links on AMQP.

Here is some information along with pointers to specific areas/concepts we may be interested in.

Specification (ISO 19464) (PDF):

https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c064955_ISO_IEC_19464_2014.zip

HTML browsable version:

This is the part related to data encoding:

http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#section-types

This is the part relating to transferring large messages (as we were discussing how to send large images etc):

http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-transport-v1.0-os.html#doc-idp484080


Regarding the multiple sub-channel discussion (called sessions in AMQP):
http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-transport-v1.0-os.html#section-sessions

Regarding the  multihop discussion, it is designed to work multihop, even though no explicit multihop features are in the specification (because additional language was not needed).

Happy to discuss this further...
