Proposed Initial Protocol 

The proposed initial protocol is based on the abstraction of a communication channel. 
A communication channel provides a means of exchanging messages between a client and a server. 
The channel can then be bound to a specific details of an underlying protocol. 

Each server implementing the common chat protocol support communication on two channels. 
The first is the control channel, and the other is the data channel. 
On both channels, messages exchanged between the client and the server consist of JSON formatted messages.
The control channel accepts inbound requests from any client without requiring authentication or authorization, 
but the data channel may only accept requests from clients that include specific authentication/authorization information. 

All JSON messages exchanged on the channels include a list of subchannels which include: 
format: which can take one of the values of 'text', 'image', 'video', 'location', 'audio', etc. 
subformat: which can be any piece of text 
content: which is a content specified according to the format 

## Discuss -- whether or not time ought to be included here. 
## Session Control -- should be done at a higher level function

All clients and servers implementing the protocol must support a format of 'text' and a subformat of 'English'.
They may optionally support other sub-format supporting other languages. 
All languages will be identified by the language type. 

A typical interaction may start by the client sending the following message on the control channel of server: 

{
"subchannel": { "format":"text", "subformat":"english", "content":"I need data channel information."}
} 

The server may response by sending the following message :
{
"subchannel": { "format":"text", "subformat":"english", "content":"Please authenticate yourself."}
} 

The client would respond by sending the following message: 
{
"subchannel": { "format":"text", "subformat":"english", "content":"My userid is foobar. My API-Key is 0x05060789."}
} 

The server would response by sending the following message :
{
"subchannel": { "format":"text", "subformat":"english", "content":"Data Channel is /data. Use Authentication token '0x0567564' for connection in field authentication-token. Authentication-token field must be specified. Only last 5 exchanges will be remembered by teh server. You need to remember and provide all exchanges older than the last 5."}
} 

If the API-Key is not valid, the server would respond as: 

{
"subchannel": { "format":"text", "subformat":"english", "content":"Invalid API-Key. Please provide a valid API-Key."}
} 

The server could also have optionally responded with the last message without requiring the client to give an API-Key.  

After receiving the data channel information, the client may also send the following requests on the data channel: 
{
"subchannel": { "format":"text", "subformat":"english", "content":"I need to check my account."}
"subchannel": { "format":"Binary", "subformat":"Authentication-Token", "content":"0x0567564"}
} 

The client on a control channel may send requests such as 
{
"subchannel": { "format":"text", "subformat":"english", "content":"I need to know your privacy policy."}
"subchannel": { "format":"binary", "subformat":"Authentication-Token", "content":"0x0567564"}
} 

The server can respond with the details of the privacy policy. 

Control channel is intended to be used for exchanges that deal with configuration, security, privacy and policy exchanges. 
Data channel is intended to be used for the business/application flow of information. In case the client sends a control channel message on the data channel or vice-versa, the server may send a respond asking the client to send it to the other channel. 

===
Supported subchannels:
The following subchannels are defined for supported by all clients and servers. 

Text sub-channel: where the format says text and subformat specifies the language 
structured sub-channel: where the format says structured and subformat is one of 'json', 'uri', 'xml' . The content is a message specified in the specified subformat.  
image sub-channel: where the format says image and subformat is the encoding of image (.png, ,jpg, .tiff etc.)
json sub-channel: where the format says json, the subformat is blank, and the content includes a json formatted message. 
binary sub-channel: where the format says 'binary' and subformat is the purpose of the binary data. The content is a hex-encoded representation of the binary data. 
location sub-channel: where the format says 'location' and subformat can be one of 'text', or 'GPS',}. The content is a description of the location in text, or the GPS coordinates. 
audio sub-channel: where the format says 'audio' and subformat identifies the encoding (.mp4 etc). The content is the audio encoded as per the subformat. 
sensor sub-channel: where the format says 'sensor' and subformat identifies the type and encoding of sensors data. The content is the sensor data encode. 
generic sub-channel: where the format says generic, and the subformat can content can be any generic entries which the client and server can mutually understand.

Binding of the Protocol to REST Services 

The binding of a control channel to a service using a REST Protocol running on a host h at port p would be https://h:p/chat_control
The binding of the data channel to a service using a REST Protocol running on a host h at port p would be https://h:p/chat_data 
In this binding the message exchanged on both channels is provided using a POST command. 

BINDING of the protocol to other Services 

======
Implementation Recommendations 

Assumption here is that the client and server are recording time or maintaining interaction logs independently. 
If they need to exchange policy information about the recording, they should do it on the control channel. 

There may be higher level session management exchanges -- e.g. whether to allow past recorded conversation to a new person joining the session. 

========
Clients that do not have capability to have NLP processing 

Such clients must initiate the conversation on the control channel with the message "I only accept json" , and list the parameters it can support e.g. 
{
"subchannel": { "format":"text", "subformat":"english", "content":"I need data channel information. I only accept json. Parameters I can process are param_value_1, param_value_2,..."}
} 

In these cases, the responses to the client must be sent using the json sub-channel. All configuration json must have the format. 
{ "param_name_1": "value_1", "param_name_1": "value_1", "param_name_1": "value_1" } where parameter names are values are for the client. 

========
Comments: 
Client should be able to specify bindings to get updates, e.g. have a websocket to get back stock quotes or have some information sent to an address via email when the task is over.
